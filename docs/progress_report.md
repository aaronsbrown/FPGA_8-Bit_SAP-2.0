# CPU Project Progress Report

**Date:** [Insert Current Date]

**Based On:** Completion of base ISA implementation and initial MMIO hardware test.

**Overall Summary:** The project has successfully implemented the core architectural changes defined in Phase 3. This includes a 16-bit address space, 8-bit opcodes, a multi-byte FSM, temporary operand registers, memory-mapped address decoding, and functional PC loading for jumps. The reset vector mechanism is functional. **The entire initial target instruction set (opcodes $00-$65, excluding IN/OUT) has been implemented in microcode and successfully tested through simulation.** This covers loads, stores, arithmetic (including with carry), logic, rotates, moves, and all conditional/unconditional branches. Furthermore, **a basic 8-bit MMIO output port at address $E000 has been implemented and successfully tested on FPGA hardware**, confirming the MMIO infrastructure and `STA` instruction. The CPU is now a significantly capable 8-bit processor. The immediate next major steps are implementing stack support (Phase 6 for CALL/RET functionality) and then developing an assembler (Phase 4).

## Phase 4: Assembler for New Architecture

- [ ] **Goal:** Create a tool to simplify writing programs.

> **Status:** **Not Started.**

---

## Phase 5: Basic I/O Peripheral Integration

- [/] **Goal:** Add UART communication capability.

> **Status:** **Blocked.** MMIO infrastructure is ready. A simple MMIO output port is done. UART itself and assembler are pending.

---

## Phase 6: Stack & Subroutine Support

- [ ] **Goal:** Enable structured programming constructs.

> **Status:** **Not Started.** Instructions `CALL`/`RET` defined but need stack implementation.

*(Phases 7-11 remain Not Started)*

## Critical Next Steps

1. **Stack Implementation (Phase 6):**
    - Design and implement `stack_pointer.sv` (16-bit, with inc/dec capabilities).
    - Add SP to `cpu.sv` datapath.
    - Implement microcode for `PHA`, `PLA` (Push/Pop Accumulator).
    - Implement microcode for `CALL`, `RET` (using SP to push/pop PC).
    - Create testbenches for all stack-related instructions.
    - (Optional: `PHP`/`PLP` for flags).
2. **Assembler (Phase 4):** Begin design and development of the assembler.
3. **Further MMIO Peripherals (Phase 5):** After STA is solid and perhaps with assembler, plan for UART or other input/output devices.
4. **Cleanup & Refinement:** Review synthesis ROM fixture strategy, ensure all documentation is up-to-date.
