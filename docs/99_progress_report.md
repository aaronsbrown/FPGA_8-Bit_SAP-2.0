# CPU Project Progress Report

**Date:** [Insert Current Date]

**Based On:** Completion of base ISA implementation and initial MMIO hardware test.

**Overall Summary:** The project has successfully implemented the core architectural changes defined in Phase 3. This includes a 16-bit address space, 8-bit opcodes, a multi-byte FSM, temporary operand registers, memory-mapped address decoding, and functional PC loading for jumps. The reset vector mechanism is functional. **The entire initial target instruction set (opcodes $00-$65, excluding IN/OUT) has been implemented in microcode and successfully tested through simulation.** This covers loads, stores, arithmetic (including with carry), logic, rotates, moves, and all conditional/unconditional branches. Furthermore, **a basic 8-bit MMIO output port at address $E000 has been implemented and successfully tested on FPGA hardware**, confirming the MMIO infrastructure and `STA` instruction. The CPU is now a significantly capable 8-bit processor. The immediate next major steps are implementing stack support (Phase 6 for CALL/RET functionality) and then developing an assembler (Phase 4).

## Phase 4: Assembler for New Architecture

- [x] **Goal:** Create a tool to simplify writing programs for the new 16-bit address, 8-bit opcode, multi-byte ISA.
- [x] **1. Design Assembler Features:**
  - [x] Support for labels (address resolution) and `EQU` constants.
  - [x] Mnemonics for all currently implemented ISA instructions.
  - [x] Parsing of 8-bit immediate values and 16-bit absolute addresses (various bases).
  - [x] Generation of correct 1, 2, or 3-byte machine code sequences (little-endian for multi-byte).
  - [x] Support for directives: `ORG`, `EQU`, `DB`, `DW`.
  - [x] Output `.hex` format suitable for `$readmemh`, supporting single or multi-region (RAM/ROM) files with relative addressing.
  - [x] Error detection and reporting for common syntax and semantic errors.
  - [x] Range checking for addresses and data values.
- [x] **2. Develop Assembler (Python):**
  - [x] Implemented using a two-pass approach (tokenization/parsing and code generation).
  - [x] Manages symbol table and instruction set definitions.
  - [x] Successfully tested against a comprehensive suite of assembly programs, including complex instruction sequences, various data definitions, control flow, and error conditions.
- [ ] **3. Toolchain Integration & Workflow Refinement:**
  - [x] Current Workflow: Assembler manually invoked to generate `.hex` fixture files (e.g., `RAM.hex`, `ROM.hex`) for specific test cases. Verilog testbenches load these fixtures.
  - [ ] Future: Consider options for more automated integration into `simulate.sh` or `build.sh` if desired.
  - [x] Project directory structure updated to separate assembly source (`asm_source/`) from assembler tool code (`python/`) and generated fixtures (`test/generated_fixtures/`).
- [ ] **4. Documentation:**
  - [ ] Document the specific assembly language syntax supported by the assembler.
  - [ ] Update project README with assembler capabilities. *(Partially done via our discussion)*

> **Phase 4 Status:** **Largely Complete.** Core assembler is functional, robust, and meets initial design goals. Remaining tasks involve refining toolchain integration if automation is desired and completing documentation.

## Phase 5: Basic I/O Peripheral Integration

- [/] **Goal:** Add UART communication capability.

> **Status:** **Blocked.** MMIO infrastructure is ready. A simple MMIO output port is done. UART itself and assembler are pending.

---

## Phase 6: Stack & Subroutine Support

- [ ] **Goal:** Enable structured programming constructs.

> **Status:** **Not Started.** Instructions `CALL`/`RET` defined but need stack implementation.

*(Phases 7-11 remain Not Started)*

## Critical Next Steps

1. **Stack Implementation (Phase 6):**
    - Design and implement `stack_pointer.sv` (16-bit, with inc/dec capabilities).
    - Add SP to `cpu.sv` datapath.
    - Implement microcode for `PHA`, `PLA` (Push/Pop Accumulator).
    - Implement microcode for `CALL`, `RET` (using SP to push/pop PC).
    - Create testbenches for all stack-related instructions.
    - (Optional: `PHP`/`PLP` for flags).
2. **Assembler (Phase 4):** Begin design and development of the assembler.
3. **Further MMIO Peripherals (Phase 5):** After STA is solid and perhaps with assembler, plan for UART or other input/output devices.
4. **Cleanup & Refinement:** Review synthesis ROM fixture strategy, ensure all documentation is up-to-date.
